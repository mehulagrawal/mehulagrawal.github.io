						<b>Why I Blog</b>
					</h2><br>
					<p>As I have observed in the 5 days of my blogging experience, this post is kind of a cliché. Lots of bloggers write about this topic and usually end up writing nothing of value. This quote, however, helps me validate my urge to embracee the cliché.<br><br>
					<blockquote>“The reason that clichés become clichés is that they are the hammers and screwdrivers in the toolbox of communication.”</blockquote><cite>Terry Pratchett</cite><br><br>
					I don't know if I would end up writing anything of value or not. What I do know is that I would have achieved from writing this blog post what I intended to get out of writing in the first place.<br><br>

					<h4><b>How I started</b></h4>I am 19. Last year I was 18. And like most 18-year olds, I had periods where I contemplated about life and my future. Things I did - Watching motivational videos on YouTube, reading "7 habits of highly successful people" and "How to win friends and influence people", trying to delve in the questions of what matters and what not, Stephen Hawking (because can't forget science), religion vs atheism etc. So, basically, the whole 'One-fifth life crisis phase: Starter Pack'.<br><br>

Somewhere in the middle of all this, I came across this guy called <a href="https://collegeinfogeek.com/">Thomas Frank</a> on YouTube. He makes videos about college life, productivity and I really got influenced by him. So much that I ended up on his website and discovered this fun little thing called Impossible list - an ever-evolving list about your goals, aspirations and everything you want out of life. I made one for me and I don't know if it was some latest TV-Show that influenced me or Thomas' website that made me list "Write a blog consistently" as a point under Personal Goals.<br><br>

I had ignored the list for quite some time and I'm not sure why I started it taking it seriously a couple of weeks back. I felt like I have so much to do. Next thing I knew, I spent a whole day designing this website from scratch and fixing the most minute of details.
<br><br>

					<h4><b>Why I actually blog</b></h4>I find that writing lets me expand on the tiniest of my daily musings on an array of topics. To put in a coherent manner, something about your life which you might never dedicate a conscious thought to, is not easy. It requires discipline, clarity and a writing skill that enables others to see things from your perspective. A common understanding is that a blog is like a journal which is not personal. However, I believe that a blog can be extremely personal in every sense except, maybe, privacy. <br><br> 

					Thinking about something and writing a thousand words on it are two completely different things. Writing about something forces you to question the core assumptions, and organise your thoughts in a nice chronological manner. It is, overall, an intellectually demanding activity. I have no doubt that I am not very good at this. But I have no doubt either that I would improve. Since blogging is such a complex activity, improving this skill would be an incredibly intellectually rewarding experience.<br><br> 

					Blogging usually has extremely poor return on investment in a purely economic sense. The time spent thinking, outlining, writing, editing and posting is almost never compensated by the (usually) zero earnings and minimal recognition. Yet, millions of other bloggers and I choose to indulge in this activity. It just serves to strengthen the above-mentioned point that blogging is in itself, an intellectually rewarding task.
